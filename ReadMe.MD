This is Brian's and Alek's first attempt at creating a number guesser. Two players are given an option to set a minimum and maximum value in which a random number will be generated. 

Once a random number is generated, the two players will keep guessing until of them guesses the random number correctly. At that point, the "winner's" name will be displayed on a card on the right side of the page. The card displays the number of guesses it took to guess the number correctly. There is also an option on the right side of the card to remove the card. 

After a game is played, the players have the option to either reset the game or clear the game. When the players press the reset button, the names will dissapear but the random number will stay the same as before. If the clear button is clicked, everything including the random number is reset.
